# This script outputs some strings for testing Combining Grapheme Joiner (CGJ).
# The name (CGJ) is confusing and doesn't reflect the functions of the character.
# CGJ is used for format control purposes but disguised (formally categorized) as a combining character.
# CGJ has multiple functions.

echo 'הַֽ הַֽ הֽ͏ַ' # Indicate the importance of the order of combining characters (Hebrew)

# The following uses of CGJ should have no visual effect and are only for text processing purposes.

echo 'ch c͏h' # Indicate "ch" is 2 letters rather than 1 letter (Czech, Slovak)
echo 'ü u͏̈' # Distinguish between umlaut and diaeresis (German)
