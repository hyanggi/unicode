# This script outputs some East Asian text for test.
# East Asian scripts are generally characterized by
# the big amounts of characters and the complex glyphs of the characters.

# -------------- Han characters ----------------
# Han characters are or were used in Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Zhuang, etc.

# Han character variants for "dragon" (East Asian mythological creatures)
echo '龍' # Traditional standard form
echo '竜' # Japanese Shinjitai (New Character Form). It is also a traditional variant form.
echo '龙' # Simplified Chinese form
echo '竜𦱉𢅛𠊋㰍𥫈龒䰱' # Traditional variant forms (as listed in the Kangxi dictionary)
# Unicode unifies variants that slightly differ in shape as one character,
# but doesn't unify variants that significantly differ.
# These variants (incl. all of the above) are encoded seperatly in Unicode.

# Han character small variants can be selected using these ways:
echo '艹艹艹' # Using compatibility characters
echo '艹艹︀艹︁' # Using standardized variation sequences that correspond to compatibility characters
echo '艹󠄀艹󠄁艹󠄂' # Using ideographic variation sequences
# Han character variants are mostly used in Japan. They are best supported by Japanese fonts.

# Han characters used in non-standard Chinese variaties
echo '俺' # Northern Mandarin (fist-person singular pronoun, first-person plural exclusive pronoun)
echo '咗' # Cantonese (perfective particle; like '了' in standard Chinese)
echo '𠲎' # Wu (interrogative particle for yes/no questions; like '吗' in standard Chinese)
echo '𧿨' # Sichuanese (to move the body randomly, to struggle, to resist)

# Han characters created in Japanese and Korean. There are only a few such characters.
# They are called "national characters" (Korean "Gukja"; Japanese "Kokuji").
# They are usually considered as Han characters to differentiate them from the native scripts of Janpanese and Korean.
echo '乭' # Korean ("stone")
echo '辻' # Japanese ("crossroads")

# Han-like characters created in Vietnamese and Zhuang. There are lots of such characters.
# They are usually not considered as Han characters to differentiate them from "real" Han characters.
# But Unicode treats them as extensions to the Han script.
echo '𡨸喃' # Vietnamese (Vietnamese locally created characters, lit. "southern characters"). The second character '喃' is also used in Chinese but with different usage.
echo '𭨡𮄫' # Zhuang (Zhuang locally created character, lit. "immature characters")


# -------- Japanese and Korean scripts -----------

# Japanese Kana are syllabics derived from Han characters.
echo 'なナ' # Hiragana and Katakana
echo '𛁾𛁿𛂀' # Hentaigana (old variant forms of Hiragana. They are closer in shape to the Han characters they are derived from.)
echo '南名奈' # Man'yōgana (original Han characters used as Kana. Modern 'な' and 'ナ' are derived from '奈'.)

# Korean Hangul is influenced by Han in shape and block arrangement.
echo '한' # Unicode precomposed Hangul syllable
echo '한ᄒᆞᆫ' # Unicode conjoining Hangul Jamo. Useful for composing syllables that do not exist in modern Korean.
